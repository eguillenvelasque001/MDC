			<h2>Vanilla Ice Cream Scoops</h2>
			<p>It&rsquo;s a scoop (actually a few scoops) of vanilla ice cream with a smooth, creamy texture and a soft off-white color. The ice cream looks rich and dense, with gentle scoop marks showing how it was shaped. It&rsquo;s served in a bowl or shell coated all around with rainbow sprinkles, which adds a fun pop of color against the simple vanilla. Overall, it looks cold, creamy, and classic—sweet and playful at the same time. 🍨✨</p>
